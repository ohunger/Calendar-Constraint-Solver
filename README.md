# Calendar Constraint Solving Algorithm
Owen Hunger

This Solver is a java algorithm that provides a solution for scheduling n meetings in a given period of time. These meetings may have constraints on them restricting the days they can be on or in respect to other meetings.

This a program that utilizes multiple algorithmic concepts including pre-processing trees using the constraints and the usage of arcs when tackling the binary constraints(meeting against meeting constraint). 


This program is meant to be the culmination of the topics learned during my Algorithms class at LMU. Although it doesn't use all the concepts/data structures etc we learned throughout the course, its difficulty accents the kind of material we learned throughout the semester.

!!!! - CSPSolver.java is the main algorithmic file where primary code was written for the project
